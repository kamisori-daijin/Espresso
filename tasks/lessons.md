# Lessons Learned

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 8 Benchmarking + Gates
- Keep cross-validation strictness split explicit: required probes must fail the run, optional probes may warn but must never mask required artifact failures.
- Emit benchmark metrics from tests in machine-readable JSON (`PHASE8_BENCHMARKS=1`) so grading/parity logic does not depend on brittle text parsing.
- Benchmark reports must always include timestamp + git SHA (or `no git repo`) in every artifact format (`json`, `csv`, `md`) to preserve auditability.
- If performance cannot be measured (host/repo limitation), mark perf as `N/A`, redistribute score weights proportionally, and attach exact blocker evidence; never silently treat missing perf data as pass.
- For Python orchestration that shells out to Swift tools, either route execution through an allowed context (elevated run) or force local cache/module paths to avoid environment-dependent failures.

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 7 Golden Fixtures, Cross-Validation, Archival
- Cross-validation fixtures must be generated from ObjC kernels, not from Swift outputs; Swift-vs-Swift fixture generation is circular and invalid as an oracle.
- When archival changes source locations (`training` -> `archive/training`), all build/capture scripts must resolve both active and archived paths to avoid silently breaking maintenance workflows.
- Golden capture scripts should write atomically via temp files and only replace existing fixtures with non-empty output; probe crashes can otherwise clobber known-good goldens.
- Golden capture scripts should be strict-by-default: any probe/generator failure must return non-zero so CI/users never get a false "goldens refreshed" signal.
- ANE compile-time assertions are sensitive to host load; never run multiple hardware test suites in parallel when compile-latency thresholds are part of the test contract.
- Keep `training/golden_outputs` stable after archival; tests should depend on committed golden artifacts only, not on re-running unstable ObjC probes during test execution.

## 2026-03-03 — CPUOps Phase 4 hardening
- Add explicit bounds contracts on pointer-indexed APIs (`targets`, `tokens`) before merge. Relying on implicit array/pointer traps is not an acceptable API contract.
- For numerical ops, add at least one direct parity test against an independent scalar reference, not only algebraic invariants (for example, RoPE invertibility alone is insufficient).
- Ensure tests named "forward/backward consistency" exercise both paths directly; derivative-only checks can leave forward path regressions undetected.
- Use non-uniform seeded fixtures for accumulation/indexing tests so layout/index bugs cannot hide behind symmetric data.

## 2026-03-03 — Phase 5a runtime review follow-up
- For C interop APIs with ambiguous `NULL` returns, always expose a machine-readable error code so Swift can preserve typed error semantics instead of collapsing to a generic failure.
- Avoid test skip logic that can mask behavior regressions; if host capability is unstable, assert that runtime behavior matches a same-run baseline rather than unconditional `XCTSkip`.
- Public runtime APIs should avoid `precondition` for recoverable misuse (for example, index validation); return typed errors and cover those paths with explicit tests.

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 6 Parity + Integration/Perf Tests
- When matching C `drand48()`-based init, reproduce both RNG draw ordering (interleaved loops) and C promotion semantics (compute in Double, cast once) for bit-identical parity.
- For long-running ANE + external-process tests, gate with `ANE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1` and an explicit opt-in env var (for example, `ESPRESSO_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`) to keep default `swift test` fast and reliable.
- Treat warnings as failures in test helpers too; avoid deprecated APIs (for example, `String(cString:)`).

## 2026-03-04 — Review Fixes (RMSNorm, Exec Restart, Weight Header)
- For normalization layers with learnable weights, finite-difference checks must use non-unit weights; unit-weight fixtures can mask whole classes of gradient bugs.
- Don’t “parity test” against a reference implementation unless the reference is independently validated; otherwise you can lock in a wrong derivative and still get green tests.
- Any codebase that uses `exec*` restarts must set `FD_CLOEXEC` (or `O_CLOEXEC`) on long-lived fds (datasets, logs, etc.), because Swift deinits won’t run across exec.
- Exec-restart should preserve full CLI state and must not assume `argv[0]` contains a `/`; prefer dyld-based executable resolution and/or `execvp` for PATH semantics.
- Binary weight loaders must validate header fields that size allocations (at minimum vocab magnitude, seqLen, heads) before reading payload to avoid truncated/OOB failures later.

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 6b Kernel/Hardware Verification
- Keep cross-validation tests behind a composable gate tier (`ANE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1` + `OBJC_CROSS_VALIDATION=1`) so default `swift test` remains deterministic and fast.
- Backward IOSurface chain invariants must be asserted explicitly: `dv` is sourced from `sdpaBwd1` output offset `0`, while `dq|dk` are sourced from `sdpaBwd2` output offset `0`.
- `tiny_train.m` is useful only for exec-restart/checkpoint lifecycle contract checks; it is not numerically comparable to `espresso-train` loss because it is a different model.
- Host-dependent gates (M4 perf target, local model assets, ANE interop instability) should be documented as explicit blocked conditions in checklist/todo artifacts, not silently treated as pass.

## 2026-03-06 — Experiment Tracking Discipline
- Use Wax MCP continuously during long ANE tuning loops: record the baseline marker, active clean worktree/branch, each experiment hypothesis, artifact directories, verdicts, and rollback notes as the work progresses.
- Treat Wax memory as part of the performance workflow, not an optional afterthought; if the user corrects memory/experiment tracking behavior, update both Wax and `tasks/lessons.md` immediately.
- When a build, test, or benchmark run hits a blocker, record the failure mode, current hypothesis, and next action in Wax session memory before continuing. The issue trail matters as much as the winning runs.

## 2026-03-10 — Wax Checkpoint Discipline
- At every major phase boundary, do all four Wax actions together: remember the key finding, write a handoff checkpoint, flush immediately, and keep a final promotion step reserved for durable confirmed results.
- Do not wait until the end of the session to create handoffs; phase checkpoints are part of the execution loop for long-running ANE experiments.

## 2026-03-06 — Performance Reporting Discipline
- Every tuning cycle must document three things explicitly: what was tried, what worked, and what did not work.
- Always explain why a change is believed to have helped, regressed, or failed to confirm; artifact-backed attribution is part of the deliverable, not optional commentary.
- Do not discard confirmed sub-1% performance improvements as “too small” without documenting them. If a small gain survives repeated confirmation and tails stay flat, commit it, document it, and then continue iterating from the improved baseline.

## 2026-03-06 — Breakthrough-Only Tuning
- When the user allows more tuning time, treat that as conditional, not open-ended: spend extra cycles only when the current evidence suggests a real architectural or scaling breakthrough rather than local noise.
- Before extending an experiment, state the breakthrough hypothesis, the concrete metric that would validate it, and the stop condition that ends the tuning loop.
- Use a scientific-critique frame for performance claims: reject time sinks driven by anecdote, uncontrolled comparisons, or metrics that cannot distinguish a real scaling advantage from benchmark variance.

## 2026-03-10 — Commit Cadence
- When the user asks for frequent commits, checkpoint smaller validated milestones instead of batching multiple tuning steps into one large uncommitted change.
- For ANE performance work, prefer commits at green boundaries: tests passing, baseline captured, or one measured avenue wired end-to-end.

## 2026-03-10 — Wax Note Format
- After every major phase, write the session note with the exact branch name and avenue name using the format: `branch`, `avenue`, `outcome`, `measurements`, `next`.
- Promote any confirmed result immediately into durable Wax memory with the same five-field format; do not leave confirmed findings in session-only notes.
- Before any pause or handoff point, write a Wax handoff for project `Espresso`, include pending tasks, then flush right away.
- Make the branch marker recoverable from Wax by always starting the note with the exact `branch:` line and flushing immediately after the write.

## 2026-03-10 — Verification Plumbing
- Keep SwiftPM test-target dependencies aligned with actual test imports; stale dependency lists can create false `no such module` failures and block focused verification of unrelated ANE work.
- For hardware-gated generation tests, run the committed XCTest seam with `ANE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1` before trusting any disposable probe; if the run stalls, sample the test process and record the exact compile stack instead of inferring the blocker.
- When hardware truth is blocked before first output, split the seam into compile/init-only control and compile/init-only candidate tests before touching runtime metrics; this cleanly separates ANE compile stalls from decode/runtime regressions.

## 2026-03-10 — Student Pivot Packaging
- When a new decode contract needs trainable artifacts but runtime truth is blocked, add a separate sidecar format instead of extending the base checkpoint/resume blob; future-head artifacts should version independently from optimizer-resume state.
- Seed new auxiliary heads from the teacher weights that already define the contract entrypoint (`rmsFinal` and classifier/embedding) so export produces a recoverable training start, not an empty placeholder.
