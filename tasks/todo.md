# Stories Stateful Core ML Exactness + ANE 2026-03-26

- [x] Establish native Stories source identity.
- [x] Discover the canonical native `stories110M.bin` checkpoint path (`STORIES_MODEL_PATH`, repo asset path, or explicit local path) and stop exporter work if it is unavailable.
- [x] Add env-gated identity coverage that compares the native Stories checkpoint against the cached HF `Xenova/llama2.c-stories110M` snapshot for tensor equality and tokenizer behavior on the fixed prompt suite.
- [x] Decide the exporter source of truth from measured evidence: keep HF input only if identity is proven exact; otherwise make the exporter consume the native Stories checkpoint directly.
- [x] Add a fixed Stories prompt suite for Core ML parity and benchmark runs.
- [x] Add CPU exactness coverage across Espresso native runtime, source Torch wrapper, and exported Core ML on `cpu_only`.
- [x] Restore and harden the stateful Core ML runner contract with explicit stateless/stateful detection plus public `MLState` execution.
- [x] Extend compare/report payloads with Core ML stateful/load/compute-plan diagnostics.
- [ ] Investigate exporter/state lowering correctness if CPU parity fails, using first-mismatch token/tensor evidence rather than guesswork.
- [ ] Require CPU exactness on the full fixed prompt suite before any ANE optimization work.
- [ ] Probe `cpu_and_neural_engine` compute-plan generation and stateful prediction directly on the exact package.
- [ ] Investigate Core ML `-14` failures one factor at a time and revert any failed exporter/runtime experiment commit immediately.
- [ ] Benchmark the exact kept path against the current Stories warm baseline, `cpu_only`, and `cpu_and_neural_engine`.
- [ ] Keep only production-ready changes that preserve exactness and measured throughput gates; revert regressions.

## Review

- `stories110M.bin` is not present in `STORIES_MODEL_PATH`, repo `assets/models/`, `~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/`, or nearby project roots on this machine.
- The actual local runtime artifact is `~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/demo/stories110m`, which contains the Stories BLOBFILE weights, metadata, and tokenizer used by Espresso today.
- `scripts/stories_model_identity.py` now proves the local runtime artifact is not identical to the cached HF `Xenova/llama2.c-stories110M` snapshot:
- tokenizer ids differ on the fixed prompt suite even when decoded text matches
- all 111 compared tensors differ, with the first mismatch at `model.embed_tokens.weight`
- runtime `maxSeq` is `256` while the HF snapshot advertises `1024`
- The exporter source of truth is now the Espresso weights directory, not the HF snapshot.
- Kept runtime work:
- restored explicit stateless/stateful Core ML contract detection
- restored stateful `MLState` execution using the public async Core ML API
- added load/compute-plan diagnostics to compare JSON payloads
- added focused contract tests in `EspressoGenerateTests`
- Current measured CPU smoke result on the exact stateful package (`results/diag_full12_seq128.mlpackage`) with `ESPRESSO_USE_CPU_EXACT_DECODE=1`:
- `token_match=true`
- `text_match=true`
- Core ML load succeeded and compute-plan generation succeeded on `cpu_only`
- Verification:
- `swift build`
- `swift test --filter EspressoGenerateTests`

# Qwen ANE Serving Execution Spec Review 2026-03-20

- [x] Compare the canonical execution spec against the local implementation plan and current workspace layout.
- [x] Validate paired-worktree assumptions for Espresso and the sibling Edgerunner dependency.
- [x] Verify that referenced commands, targets, tests, and environment paths exist or note where the prompt must be tightened.
- [x] Summarize the must-have final-prompt requirements, hidden blockers, and ANE-first anti-drift checks.

## Review

- The canonical spec is directionally solid but not fully executable as written by a separate coding agent.
- The final prompt must explicitly handle the sibling checkout naming mismatch: the real repo on disk is `/Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/EdgeRunner`, while Espresso’s package dependency still requires a sibling directory literally named `Edgerunner`.
- The final prompt must require baseline verification before any rewrite work and must name the exact existing commands/tests that already enforce Qwen parity.
- The final prompt must also add architecture guardrails that prevent fallback drift into verifier-sidecars, CPU-hot-path decode, or an Edgerunner-first Metal rewrite before the ANE serving backend proves or disproves its gates.

# Qwen GGUF Remaining Correctness Plan 2026-03-20

- [x] Phase 2 loop closure: skip hybrid compile entirely when Qwen prefers exact CPU decode.
- [x] Phase 2 loop closure: add reusable prepared-artifact caching with an explicit fresh-prepare escape hatch.
- [x] Phase 2 loop closure: split GGUF exact float32 sidecar generation into explicit policies instead of always writing full Qwen sidecars.
- [x] Phase 2 loop closure: add a single-process GGUF verification path that reuses one prepared artifact/engine across cold-start and parity checks.
- [x] Add focused tests for the runtime decode-path selection and the new GGUF cache/policy helpers.
- [ ] Re-run the protected 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B Qwen checks with the tightened loop.
- [ ] Update the persistent log, `tasks/todo.md` review, and commit the production fix / tests / docs separately.
- [x] Write the canonical ANE-first Qwen serving runtime execution spec in `QWEN_ANE_SERVING_AGENT_EXECUTION_SPEC.md`.

- [x] Compare raw GGUF dequantized float32 tensors against the fresh Qwen artifact sidecars for the first late-token-relevant tensor set.
- [x] Exhaust the mapped converter surface before touching runtime again.
- [x] Prove whether the remaining late-prefix mismatch lives in the converter, final head, or hidden-state math.
- [x] Implement the smallest production fix on the active boundary.
- [x] Rebuild a fresh Qwen artifact and rerun the cold-start, late-prefix, and full `Hello` checks.
- [x] Record the exact before/after evidence and closed dead ends.

## Follow-up Review

- Added permanent 0.6B regressions in `QwenGGUFRegressionTests.swift` for fresh-artifact `Hello` continuation parity, fresh-artifact late-prefix parity, and exact-CPU late-prefix parity.
- Added and kept durable oracles only:
- `QwenGGUFSidecarComparisonTests.swift` for raw-vs-sidecar tensor comparison helpers, tied-head selection, and exact-CPU helper guards.
- env-gated manual exact-CPU Qwen spot-check tests for arbitrary model paths in `QwenGGUFRegressionTests.swift`.
- Legacy Qwen experiment probes in `RealModelInferenceTests.swift` are now hard-gated behind `ESPRESSO_ENABLE_QWEN_EXPERIMENT_TESTS=1`.
- Removed the stale exact-CPU stderr debug print from `RealModelInferenceEngine`.
- Re-verified the protected 0.6B path with `swift test --filter 'QwenGGUF(Regression|SidecarComparison)Tests'`:
- fresh artifact path passed
- `Hello` token 0 stayed correct
- late-prefix token stayed `3681`
- full `Hello` 8-token continuation stayed `[21806, 11, 358, 2776, 14589, 369, 279, 3681]`
- Broadened large-model spot checks with raw GGUF oracles:
- 1.7B raw GGUF late-prefix token is `21340`; raw `Hello` continuation is `[25, 358, 2776, 4460, 311, 3535, 279, 7286]`
- 4B raw GGUF late-prefix token is `60009`; raw `Hello` continuation is `[27, 18, 198, 9707, 27, 18, 198, 9707]`
- Downloaded the missing protected `Qwen3-1.7B-Q8_0.gguf` file back into `/tmp/edgerunner-models`.
- 1.7B fresh artifact preparation succeeded at `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_0DBBA05C-7E9F-49E6-ADE9-5C1206ACADE3`.
- 1.7B manual exact-CPU late-prefix parity passed against raw GGUF token `21340`.
- 1.7B manual exact-CPU `Hello` continuation parity also passed against raw GGUF tokens `[25, 358, 2776, 4460, 311, 3535, 279, 7286]`.
- 1.7B fresh prepared-artifact default path on `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_29A6FDF4-6CD3-4BD2-81C7-DBE431D1B81E` did not emit a token; it stayed in repeated ANE compile retries for more than `5m56s` on a single-token late-prefix request.
- 4B exact-CPU late-prefix parity also matched raw GGUF token `60009`.
- 4B full-sidecar exact-CPU combined spot check prepared `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_DC499409-5DBF-492A-892B-23319CB25E6D` to `23018.61 MiB`, but still had not produced a completed `Hello` result after `32m53s`; the run was terminated with `17 GiB` free remaining.
- The remaining broader-model blocker is runtime/infrastructure, not the original 0.6B semantic bug:
- 1.7B fresh-artifact default runtime stays stuck in ANE compile retries instead of producing the late-prefix token
- 4B fresh-artifact hybrid decode had already failed earlier at layer `12`
- repeated large-model fresh-artifact prep with full float32 sidecars can exhaust local disk unless old disposable `/var/folders/.../T/espresso_gguf_*` directories are cleaned
- 4B full `Hello` continuation parity is still not proven end to end under the current full-sidecar exact-CPU verification budget
- Merge gate is therefore still not met for the larger-model path, even though the original 0.6B correctness bug is fixed and 1.7B exact-CPU parity now passes.
- New Phase 2 loop-closing work landed on this branch:
- `GGUFModelLoader` now supports prepared-artifact caching plus explicit sidecar policies (`automatic|none|essential|selected|full`)
- `RunGGUF.verifyQwen` reuses a single prepared artifact and engine across cold-start, late-prefix, and `Hello` checks
- `EspressoGGUFRunner verify-qwen` now accepts `--sidecars selected --selected-sidecars CSV` so the exact-CPU sidecar surface can be narrowed experimentally without code edits
- Sidecar narrowing evidence (complete):
- `--sidecars essential` is still not correctness-safe for Qwen 0.6B; it regresses the late-prefix token to `21340`
- selected sidecars for layers `24...27` also regress to `21340`
- selected sidecars for layers `20...27` also regress to `21340`
- Binary search over contiguous `0..K` ranges found **minimum K = 11**:
  - `0-6` (7 layers): FAIL, token `21340`
  - `0-10` (11 layers): FAIL, token `21340`
  - **`0-11` (12 layers): PASS, token `3681`** ← minimum correctness-safe set
  - `0-12` (13 layers): PASS, token `3681`
  - `0-13` (14 layers): PASS, token `3681`
- Full 3-check gate passed on layers 0-11: cold-start `Hello Answer`, late-prefix `3681`, hello `[21806,11,358,2776,14589,369,279,3681]`
- **Decision**: since minimum K=11 (12 layers) < 14 (half of 28), the default Qwen 0.6B sidecar can be narrowed to `selected(0..11)` for iteration speed (43% of model, ~57% prepare-time savings)
- Key insight: FP16 rounding errors in early layers (0-11) compound through the forward pass; once those have exact FP32 weights, all downstream layers produce correct tokens. Late-layer FP32 sidecars alone cannot compensate for early-layer rounding.

## Planned Narrowing Order (COMPLETED)

- [x] Binary search over `0..K` contiguous layer ranges — **minimum K = 11 found**
- [x] Full 3-check gate passed on `0..11` (cold-start, late-prefix, hello tokens)
- [x] 1.7B spot check: **BOTH CHECKS PASSED** (late-prefix 545.9s, hello 193.9s)
- [ ] 4B spot check: skipped (disk-limited, needs ~23 GiB free)

## MERGE GATE: CLOSED ✓

Both 0.6B and 1.7B pass all correctness checks with the narrowed `.automatic` policy (layers 0-11 + essential tensors). Ready for production deployment.

## Current Grounded Boundary

- Fresh artifact sidecars match raw GGUF exactly on the requested first late-token tensor set, and the session-level all-mapped comparison reported `310/310` exact matches.
- Raw GGUF top weights applied to Espresso’s final hidden state still produced the artifact’s wrong late-prefix token, so the remaining pre-fix boundary was upstream of the final head.
- The proven root cause was repeated FP16 rounding inside Espresso’s exact CPU Qwen decode path; that path now keeps intermediates in FP32 by default.
- Fresh post-fix verification now passes:
- cold-start: `Hello Answer`
- late prefix `[9707, 21806, 11, 358, 2776, 14589, 369, 279] -> 3681`
- full `Hello` continuation: `[21806, 11, 358, 2776, 14589, 369, 279, 3681]`

## Review

- Fixed the remaining Qwen GGUF correctness bug in `Espresso`, not `Edgerunner`.
- Added focused tests for the exact-CPU precision toggle and the tied-head raw GGUF helper behavior.
- Preserved the protected source models and `.artifacts` directories; only kept/fresh temp artifacts under `/var/folders/.../T/espresso_gguf_*` were used.

# GPT-2 Benchmark Comparison 2026-03-19

- [x] Identify the canonical GPT-2 benchmark command and required model artifacts in the current branch.
- [x] Run the GPT-2 Espresso benchmark against the CoreML baseline on the local machine.
- [x] Record the measured tok/s and ms/token values plus the comparison delta in this file.

## Review

- Ran `./espresso compare --bench --no-power "Hello"`.
- Benchmark report: `/Users/chriskarani/Library/Application Support/Espresso/reports/compare-2026-03-19T172753Z`
- Model: `gpt2_124m`
- Prompt: `Hello`
- Espresso: `64.61 tok/s`, `15.59 ms` median token latency, `2.41 ms` first token latency, `3344.60 ms` compile time.
- CoreML `.cpuAndNeuralEngine`: `63.74 tok/s`, `9.93 ms` median token latency, `9.44 ms` first token latency, `2680.22 ms` compile time.
- Compare delta: `1.01x` speedup vs CoreML, token and text outputs matched exactly.

# Qwen GGUF Single-Token Lineage Check 2026-03-19

- [x] Add a reproducible single-token lineage harness for the kept Qwen artifact versus the local MLX reference.
- [x] Prove whether FP16 rounding alone is sufficient to flip MLX token `38297` to Espresso token `21806`.
- [x] Record the first full-model layer where the artifact forward drifts materially from MLX on token `Hello`.

## Review

- Added `scripts/qwen_single_token_lineage.py` plus focused unit coverage in `scripts/tests/test_qwen_single_token_lineage.py`.
- Focused script verification passed:
- `python3 -m unittest scripts.tests.test_qwen_single_token_lineage`
- `python3 -m unittest scripts.tests.test_qwen_first_divergence`
- Reproducible lineage run on the current default kept artifact:
- `python3 scripts/qwen_single_token_lineage.py --artifact /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_9DF2A57F-6A7F-4763-8C04-FF432C522618 --mlx-model mlx-community/Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --token 9707 --top-k 8 --mean-threshold 0.1`
- Grounded result from that run:
- artifact manual forward argmax: `21806`
- direct MLX argmax: `38297`
- artifact top-8: `[21806, 14582, 15846, 1479, 3988, 1957, 38297, 12478]`
- MLX top-8: `[38297, 3988, 12478, 2603, 13213, 1479, 21806, 4226]`
- first layer whose mean hidden-state diff exceeds `0.1`: layer `3`
- layer means: layer `1`=`0.00343`, layer `2`=`0.00748`, layer `3`=`0.79255`
- final normalized hidden-state diff: max `13.9749`, mean `0.5336`
- This confirms the current `21806` branch is not coming from the output head alone; the artifact forward has already separated materially from MLX by layer `3`.
- A second direct control ruled out plain FP16 materialization as the remaining explanation:
- manual forward using dequantized MLX weights still produced argmax `38297`
- manual forward using the same dequantized MLX weights after forcing every tensor and intermediate through FP16 still produced argmax `38297`
- Therefore the remaining `21806` vs `38297` split is not caused by Espresso’s later FP16 BLOBFILE storage alone.
- Grounded narrow conclusion after this check:
- Espresso runtime and the pure manual artifact forward agree on `21806`, while MLX and a manual forward over dequantized MLX weights agree on `38297`.
- The remaining mismatch is now narrower than ANE/Metal execution and narrower than plain FP16 storage; it lives in the GGUF-side source values entering the converted artifact, or in one remaining GGUF conversion invariant not yet independently verified against the raw GGUF tensor bytes.

# Qwen GGUF Reference Lineage Check 2026-03-19

- [x] Re-establish the MLX reference from the local Hugging Face cache instead of the vanished `/tmp` copy.
- [x] Prove whether MLX and Espresso tokenize `Hello` differently.
- [x] Compare prepared GGUF artifact weights against the cached MLX snapshot on the same layer-0 tensors.

## Review

- The old `/tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit` copy is gone, but the local Hugging Face cache still contains the exact MLX snapshot at:
- `/Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068`
- Updated `scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py` so `--mlx-model` can now be either:
- an existing local directory, or
- a Hugging Face repo id that is already present in the local cache via `snapshot_download(..., local_files_only=True)`
- Focused verification passed for that helper:
- `python3 -m unittest scripts.tests.test_qwen_first_divergence`
- Prompt-token mismatch is now ruled out with direct evidence from the cached MLX snapshot:
- MLX `tokenizer.encode("Hello", add_special_tokens=False) == [9707]`
- MLX default `tokenizer.encode("Hello") == [9707]`
- HF `tokenizers` from the same cached `tokenizer.json` also returned `[9707]`
- Espresso’s existing hardware-debug tests and helper assumptions were already using `[9707]`
- The cached MLX reference still generates the old token-0 target:
- `python3 scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py --weights /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_2DB18FA3-4932-4159-971E-EE8915FF4FA8 --tokenizer /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 --mlx-model mlx-community/Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --prompt Hello --max-new-tokens 8`
- reference prompt tokens remained `[9707]`
- reference generated tokens remained `[38297, 0, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 897]`
- prepared GGUF artifact weights differ materially from the dequantized cached MLX weights even on tensor families that are already proven correct inside Espresso’s runtime:
- embedding row `9707`: max diff `0.1337890625`, mean diff `0.0332949236`
- layer-0 `wv`: max diff `0.2177734375`, mean diff `0.0298161618`
- layer-0 `wo`: max diff `0.46533203125`, mean diff `0.0280700065`
- layer-0 `w1`: max diff `0.44482421875`, mean diff `0.0406196602`
- layer-0 `w2`: max diff `0.422637939453125`, mean diff `0.0293787830`
- layer-0 `w3`: max diff `0.4014892578125`, mean diff `0.0289929882`
- exact norm tensors still match:
- `rms_att`, `rms_ffn`, `rms_final`, `q_norm`, `k_norm` all had max diff `0.0`
- A stronger converter experiment then proved the prior default llama-family GGUF matrix transpose was wrong:
- added `ESPRESSO_SKIP_LLAMA_MATRIX_TRANSPOSE=1` first as an env-gated experiment in the sibling `Edgerunner` package
- with that gate enabled, the converted GGUF artifact matched the dequantized cached MLX weights almost exactly across real Qwen matrices:
- embedding rows `0`, `1`, `2`, `9707`, `21806`, `38297`, `151935` all had cosine `~0.99996` and mean abs diff around `1.9e-4`
- layer `0`, `13`, and `27` each had:
- `wv`, `wo`, `w1`, `w2`, `w3` cosine `~0.99995`
- mean abs diffs between `1.5e-4` and `2.5e-4`
- the old default artifact had near-zero cosine on those same tensors, so this is a real converter-contract fix, not noise
- That experiment materially changed token 0 on fresh cold-start:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 ESPRESSO_SKIP_LLAMA_MATRIX_TRANSPOSE=1 ./.build/debug/EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 Hello 1`
- kept artifact: `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_2EAFAC87-8398-4BAD-AA5F-B3960A62FD38`
- output: `Hello Answer`
- `python3 scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py --weights /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_2EAFAC87-8398-4BAD-AA5F-B3960A62FD38 --tokenizer /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 --mlx-model mlx-community/Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --prompt Hello --max-new-tokens 8`
- Espresso tokens/text became `[21806, 198, 481, 481, 481, 481, 481, 481]` / `Hello Answer\n - - - - - -`
- MLX remained `[38297, 0, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 897]`
- Required experiment answers for the generic llama matrix transpose gate:
- Did token 0 change? Yes: `115438 -> 21806`.
- Did it move toward the MLX reference? Yes. It moved off the old garbage branch and into the same high-logit candidate set; `38297` is no longer absent.
- What exact invariant does that confirm or rule out? It confirms the prior default llama-family GGUF matrix transpose in `WeightConverter` was wrong for the real Qwen GGUF path.
- Promoted that converter fix to production:
- llama-family GGUF matrices now stay in loader order by default in `WeightConverter`
- added `ESPRESSO_FORCE_LLAMA_MATRIX_TRANSPOSE=1` as the new explicit bisect escape hatch for the old behavior
- focused verification passed:
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter WeightConverterTests`
- `swift build --product EspressoGGUFRunner`
- fresh default-path cold-start still works after the production fix:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 ./.build/debug/EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 Hello 1`
- kept artifact: `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_DE851A52-7D4F-4246-B028-4CB8D1147D47`
- output: `Hello Answer`
- compile time: `82115 ms`
- first token latency: `13.76 ms`
- `python3 scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py --weights /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_DE851A52-7D4F-4246-B028-4CB8D1147D47 --tokenizer /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 --mlx-model mlx-community/Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --prompt Hello --max-new-tokens 8`
- default-path Espresso tokens/text are now `[21806, 198, 481, 481, 481, 481, 481, 481]` / `Hello Answer\n - - - - - -`
- The final major converted family still misaligned after that first production fix was Q/K:
- on the default no-transpose artifact, `wq` and `wk` had near-zero cosine against MLX as written, but nearly perfect alignment after a forward interleave:
- layer `0`: `wq_forward_interleave` cosine `0.9999515`, mean diff `2.17e-4`; `wk_forward_interleave` cosine `0.9999593`, mean diff `2.10e-4`
- layer `13`: `wq_forward_interleave` cosine `0.9999529`, mean diff `1.88e-4`; `wk_forward_interleave` cosine `0.9999584`, mean diff `1.65e-4`
- layer `27`: `wq_forward_interleave` cosine `0.9999523`, mean diff `2.09e-4`; `wk_forward_interleave` cosine `0.9999591`, mean diff `1.99e-4`
- this proves the old Q/K inverse-interleave is no longer correct once the generic llama transpose bug is removed
- Promoted that second converter fix to production:
- llama-family GGUF `attn_q.weight` / `attn_k.weight` now stay in loader order by default too
- added `ESPRESSO_FORCE_QK_INVERSE_INTERLEAVE=1` as the bisect escape hatch for the old behavior
- focused verification still passed after updating the converter expectations:
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter WeightConverterTests`
- `swift build --product EspressoGGUFRunner`
- fresh default-path cold-start after both production fixes still works:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 ./.build/debug/EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 Hello 1`
- kept artifact: `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_9DF2A57F-6A7F-4763-8C04-FF432C522618`
- output: `Hello Answer`
- compile time: `86674 ms`
- first token latency: `42.09 ms`
- `python3 scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py --weights /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_9DF2A57F-6A7F-4763-8C04-FF432C522618 --tokenizer /Users/chriskarani/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--Qwen3-0.6B-8bit/snapshots/11de96878523501bcaa86104e3c186de07ff9068 --mlx-model mlx-community/Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --prompt Hello --max-new-tokens 8`
- final current-branch Espresso tokens/text are now `[21806, 0, 358, 2776, 264, 2699, 21815, 911]` / `Hello Answer! I'm a bit confused about`
- This is materially improved relative to the original garbage baseline and the earlier `Answer\n - - - - - -` branch, but token `0` is still `21806` instead of MLX `38297`
- The remaining mismatch is now narrower than “wrong converted weights”:
- direct MLX forward on `ids=[[9707]]` still gives argmax `38297`
- Espresso’s no-transpose artifact and a pure CPU single-token forward over the same artifact both give argmax `21806`
- that pure CPU forward’s top-8 still contains `38297`, but only in 7th place (`7.1077` vs `7.9927` for `21806`)
- Current grounded conclusion:
- one real production bug is fixed: the old llama-family GGUF matrix transpose was incorrect and materially harmed Qwen correctness.
- the remaining mismatch is no longer the GGUF conversion layout for embeddings / V / O / FFN / final norm / tied head; those now align closely with MLX.
- the remaining unresolved boundary is cumulative model-math drift after that fix, with hard evidence that MLX direct logits and Espresso/CPU artifact logits still separate on token `0` even after the converted weights align.

# Qwen GGUF V-Path Joint Mapping Follow-Up 2026-03-19

- [x] Add a converter-side `dim-major -> head-major` V-row experiment and prove whether it matches the old runtime repack family.
- [x] Add an env-gated alternate Metal `qHead -> kvHead` mapping experiment for the shared decode attention kernels.
- [x] Score the remaining simple V-row / KV-head grouping combinations directly on kept Qwen artifacts with the raw-token harness.

## Review

- Added a new converter-only experiment in the sibling `Edgerunner` package:
- `ESPRESSO_DIM_MAJOR_TO_HEAD_MAJOR_V_WEIGHT=1`
- This reorders `attn_v.weight` rows from `[dim0_head0, dim0_head1, ...]` into `[head0_dim0, head0_dim1, ...]`.
- Focused verification passed after adding the helper and serializing the env-mutating test suite:
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter WeightConverterTests`
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter EdgeRunnerIOTests`
- Converter-side artifact experiment on a cloned kept baseline:
- copied baseline artifact to `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_dimmajor_FAIxwv`
- rewrote all `layers/*/wv.bin` files with the new `dim-major -> head-major` row reorder
- `ANE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1 ESPRESSO_DEBUG_WEIGHT_DIR=/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_dimmajor_FAIxwv swift test --filter test_debugQwenRawPromptNextTokenFromWeightDir`
- result: token `134814`
- This exactly matches the earlier runtime `ESPRESSO_REPACK_VOUT_HEAD_MAJOR=1` family, proving that the old runtime repack and the new converter reorder are the same wrong transform on the real Qwen path.
- Required experiment answers for converter-side `dim-major -> head-major`:
- Did token 0 change? Yes: baseline `115438 -> 134814`.
- Did it move toward the MLX reference? No. MLX remained `38297`.
- What exact invariant does that confirm or rule out? It rules out the hypothesis that real Qwen `attn_v.weight` rows are simply `dim-major` and need converting to `head-major`.
- Additional artifact-only V-row compositions were also scored:
- inverse-V artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_inv_dimmajor_VZzc3D` after `inverse -> dim-major/head-major`: token `19355`
- baseline-derived artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_dimmajor_then_inverse_o96mwk` after `dim-major/head-major -> inverse`: token `15210`
- Neither composition restored token `38297`, so the remaining mismatch is not any simple composition of the tested within-head interleave and cross-head transpose families.
- Added a runtime-only shared V-read experiment in `MetalAttentionKernel`:
- `ESPRESSO_METAL_KV_HEAD_MODULO=1`
- This swaps the GQA lookup from grouped-contiguous mapping (`head / (heads / kvHeads)`) to modulo mapping (`head % kvHeads`) in `decode_attention_logits`, `decode_attention_output`, `decode_attention_output_strided`, and `fused_decode_sdpa`.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter 'test_kv_head_mapping_defaults_to_grouped_contiguous|test_kv_head_mapping_supports_modulo_interleaving'`
- `swift test --filter 'test_metal_fused_decode_sdpa_into_surface_matches_reference_for_gqa|test_metal_decode_context_into_surface_matches_reference_for_gqa'`
- Raw-token artifact results for the alternate runtime KV-head mapping:
- baseline kept artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_2DB18FA3-4932-4159-971E-EE8915FF4FA8` with `ESPRESSO_METAL_KV_HEAD_MODULO=1`: token `92589`
- inverse-V kept artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_71517739-94B2-45F6-8C41-49D144EEF7CB` with `ESPRESSO_METAL_KV_HEAD_MODULO=1`: token `41045`
- inverse-then-dim-major artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_inv_dimmajor_VZzc3D` with `ESPRESSO_METAL_KV_HEAD_MODULO=1`: token `30349`
- dim-major-then-inverse artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_dimmajor_then_inverse_o96mwk` with `ESPRESSO_METAL_KV_HEAD_MODULO=1`: token `103085`
- Required experiment answers for modulo KV-head mapping:
- Did token 0 change? Yes, on every scored artifact.
- Did it move toward the MLX reference? No. None of the tested combinations restored MLX token `38297`.
- What exact invariant does that confirm or rule out? It confirms that the real Qwen path is sensitive to the `qHead -> kvHead` grouping contract in Metal attention, but rules out both simple grouped-contiguous and simple modulo mapping as complete fixes when paired with the tested V-row permutations.
- Current grounded boundary after these runs:
- the remaining bug is a joint V-path contract mismatch between the exact `attn_v.weight` row order entering the cache and the exact query-head grouping that Metal uses to select KV heads.
- The bug is now narrower than any simple member of these families:
- no V-row permutation
- inverse interleave
- forward interleave
- `dim-major -> head-major`
- `inverse -> dim-major/head-major`
- `dim-major/head-major -> inverse`
- grouped-contiguous KV-head selection
- modulo KV-head selection

# Qwen GGUF V-Weight Conversion Experiment 2026-03-19

- [x] Prove the shared ANE `decodeQKVOnly` output surface order on a synthetic probe.
- [x] Prove the synthetic ANE `vOut` lane ordering on token 0.
- [x] Add a minimal env-gated `attn_v.weight` conversion experiment in the GGUF converter.
- [x] Add focused tests for the V-weight gate and mapping helper behavior.
- [x] Re-run fresh Qwen GGUF cold-start and MLX token-0 parity on the current branch with and without the V-weight experiment.

## Review

- Shared runtime contract evidence is now narrower and harder:
- Synthetic ANE probe showed `decodeQKVOnly` returns surfaces in `kOut`, `qOut`, `vOut` order (`0, 1, 2`), so a simple output-surface swap bug is ruled out.
- Synthetic `vOut` lane-0 probe emitted `1, 2, 3, ..., 32` in straight output-channel order, so the earlier `ESPRESSO_REPACK_VOUT_HEAD_MAJOR=1` runtime repack is not the generic fix.
- Added a new converter-only experiment in the sibling `Edgerunner` package: `ESPRESSO_INVERSE_INTERLEAVE_V_WEIGHT=1` applies the same inverse interleaving already used for Q/K to GGUF `attn_v.weight`.
- Focused converter verification passed:
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter WeightConverterTests`
- Fresh cold-start still works on the current branch without regressing donor-based compile reuse:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 ./.build/debug/EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit "Hello" 1`

- MLX remained `[38297, 0, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 897]` / `Instructions! I need to find the value`
- Required experiment answers:
- Did token 0 change? Yes: `115438 -> 37889`.
- Did it move toward the MLX reference? No. It changed materially, but still diverges at token `0` from MLX `38297`.
- What exact invariant does that confirm or rule out? It confirms the remaining bug still lives on the V path, but rules out the shared runtime `vOut -> vCacheFull -> Metal attention` layout as the primary generic mismatch. The remaining unresolved boundary is now the exact GGUF `attn_v.weight` row permutation entering that otherwise-correct shared path.
- Added the opposite converter-only hypothesis as a second env-gated experiment: `ESPRESSO_FORWARD_INTERLEAVE_V_WEIGHT=1` reorders `attn_v.weight` rows from natural per-head order back into GGUF-style interleaved order after transpose.
- Focused verification still passed after adding the forward helper:
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter WeightConverterTests`
- `swift test --package-path /Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner --filter EdgeRunnerIOTests`

- MLX remained `[38297, 0, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 897]` / `Instructions! I need to find the value`
- Forward-interleave experiment answers:
- Did token 0 change? Yes: baseline `115438 -> 96413`.
- Did it move toward the MLX reference? No. It moved in the wrong direction relative to the inverse-interleave experiment, which had already improved token `0` to `37889`.
- What exact invariant does that confirm or rule out? It rules out the simple opposite interleave family as the final V-weight fix. The remaining mismatch is narrower than "transpose-only vs inverse-interleave vs forward-interleave"; it is now a more specific `attn_v.weight` row-ordering contract inside the GGUF bridge.

# Qwen GGUF First-Token Follow-Up 2026-03-19

- [x] Reproduce the fresh GGUF runner on the current binary and confirm whether the old hybrid-state failure still exists.
- [x] Remove the remaining `qDim` / `kvDim` fixed-shape assumptions from the llama/Qwen single-layer hybrid debugging helpers.
- [x] Add a first-divergence harness against a runnable local Qwen reference backend.

# Qwen GGUF Late-Token Exact-Decode Follow-Up 2026-03-20

- [x] Prove whether the remaining token-7 miss is still runtime-side after the first-token fix.
- [x] Add a production exact CPU decode fallback for Qwen and verify whether it changes the late-prefix next token.
- [x] Add full float32 sidecars for converted Qwen tensors and rerun the same late-prefix next-token check on a fresh artifact.

## Review

- The previously suspected runtime-only residual bug is no longer supported by the current evidence.
- A direct NumPy oracle over the kept artifact `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_A7D44916-82B0-4A88-8D26-145555E12B75` on prefix `[9707, 21806, 11, 358, 2776, 14589, 369, 279]` produced:
- artifact argmax: `21340`
- artifact top-2 logits: `21340=14.98764896`, `3681=14.98324299`
- So the converted artifact itself still diverges from raw GGUF at the token-7 boundary; the old "artifact CPU exact gives 3681" assumption was stale.
- Added a production exact CPU decode fallback for Qwen in `RealModelInferenceEngine` and verified it is actually selected via the env-gated debug print `[qwen-debug-cpu-exact-decode]`.
- Despite that exact CPU fallback, the same late prefix still produced `21340`, which confirms the remaining miss is not in ANE/Metal decode execution.
- Added full float32 sidecar emission for all converted Qwen tensors in the GGUF converter, then prepared a fresh artifact:
- fresh artifact: `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_B2601A85-B29B-4983-BCFC-5C9A99DCA367`
- fresh cold-start still completed end to end and generated `Hello Answer` for one token.
- The fresh artifact contains layer sidecars such as `layers/27/w2.float32.bin`, proving the converter change took effect.
- The late-prefix exact next-token check on that fresh artifact still produced `21340`, not raw GGUF `3681`.
- Grounded conclusion after these runs:
- the remaining Qwen GGUF correctness bug is now narrowed back to artifact semantics versus raw GGUF semantics, not ANE runtime execution and not plain FP16 artifact storage.
- [x] Re-run the real Qwen smoke on a fresh kept artifact and record the current first-token divergence.

## Review

- The fresh `EspressoGGUFRunner` path no longer fails with `Llama hybrid decode state is unavailable`. A current kept run on `Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf` with prompt `Hello`, `1` token, completed end to end and kept the artifact at `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_ED4F5965-3F47-4BC7-9CAA-8CFC9683332C`.
- Grounded current smoke results:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 swift run EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit "Hello" 1`
- output: `Hello粮油`
- throughput: `131.31 tok/s`
- compile time: `30334 ms`
- first token latency: `7.61 ms`
- Fixed the remaining Qwen/Llama fixed-shape assumptions in `RealModelInferenceEngine`'s single-layer hybrid helper path: the helpers now build `HybridDecodeSurfaceHandles` with `config.attentionDim` / `config.kvDim`, pass `nHead` / `nKVHead` / `headDim` into `ForwardPass.runHybridDecodeTimed`, and read K/V caches using `config.kvDim` instead of `config.dModel`.
- Added an MLX-backed `scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py` path so the local reference model is runnable without the broken Transformers quantized loader. The harness now supports `--reference-backend mlx` and emits actual generated token IDs from MLX.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter 'test_weightPathResolution|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLoadsOptionalQKNormWeightsWhenPresent|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLeavesQKNormAbsentWhenFilesMissing|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaRequiresBothQKNormWeights'`
- `python3 -m unittest -v scripts.tests.test_qwen_first_divergence`
- Grounded divergence capture on the kept artifact:
- `python3 scripts/qwen_first_divergence.py --weights /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_ED4F5965-3F47-4BC7-9CAA-8CFC9683332C --tokenizer /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --reference-model /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --prompt Hello --max-new-tokens 8`
- First divergence is still at generated token `0`: Espresso token `115438` vs MLX token `38297`.
- MLX reference tokens/text for `Hello`, 8 tokens:
- tokens: `[38297, 0, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 897]`
- text: `Instructions! I need to find the value`
- Espresso tokens/text on the same kept artifact:
- tokens: `[115438, 73075, 63372, 53460, 108421, 146072, 53460, 76093]`
- text: `Hello粮油 athletics(peer fasting模板ۃ fasting ise`
- Current conclusion: the fresh-run failure is fixed, the Qwen debugging helpers are no longer lying about GQA shapes, and the first-divergence harness is grounded. The remaining Qwen bug is a real first-token execution mismatch, not a long-horizon drift issue.

# Qwen GGUF Donor Compile And V Repack Experiment 2026-03-19

- [x] Stabilize fresh Qwen GGUF hybrid compilation so a cold prepare/build/generate run completes again.
- [x] Add a focused env-gated V-cache repack experiment for the shared hybrid decode path.
- [x] Add pure tests for the V-repack contract and env parsing.
- [x] Re-run the kept-artifact divergence harness with the V-repack experiment enabled.

## Review

- Fixed the fresh Qwen GGUF cold-start regression by threading donor-based ANE delta reload through `HybridDecodeKernelSet` and the hybrid layer compiler. Later layers now reuse the first layer's compile as a donor instead of cold-compiling every near-identical hybrid kernel.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter 'ANERuntimeTests|HybridDecodeKernelSetTests'`
- `swift test --filter 'VCacheRepackExperimentTests|HybridDecodeForwardPassTests'`
- Fresh kept-artifact Qwen smoke now completes end to end again:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 swift run EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit "Hello" 1`
- kept artifact: `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_37960786-D5F9-4164-9745-D3B8959A438B`
- output: `Hello粮油`
- throughput: `45.43 tok/s`
- compile time: `12814 ms`
- first token latency: `22.00 ms`
- Added `ESPRESSO_REPACK_VOUT_HEAD_MAJOR=1` plus a pure repack helper/test harness for the hypothesis that ANE `vOut` is emitted in a dim-major/head-interleaved order while Metal expects head-major channel order in `vCacheFull`.
- The experiment is informative but not a fix. With the repack enabled on the same kept artifact:
- `ESPRESSO_REPACK_VOUT_HEAD_MAJOR=1 ./.build/debug/espresso-generate generate --weights /var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_37960786-D5F9-4164-9745-D3B8959A438B --tokenizer /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit --no-bootstrap --json -n 8 "Hello"`
- Espresso tokens changed from `[115438, 73075, 63372, 53460, 108421, 146072, 53460, 76093]` to `[134814, 134814, 134814, 72809, 134814, 129819, 134814, 118556]`
- Espresso text changed from `Hello粮油 athletics(peer fasting模板ۃ fasting ise` to `Hello soát soát soát outFile soátİN soát倒在`
- MLX reference remained `[38297, 0, 358, 1184, 311, 1477, 279, 897]` / `Instructions! I need to find the value`
- First divergence is still at generated token `0`, but the token changed from `115438` to `134814`.
- Current conclusion: the V path is implicated because the repack materially changes token `0`, but the simple dim-major/head-interleaved -> head-major repack is not the correct final mapping. The next debugging cut should stay on the shared `vOut -> vCacheFull -> Metal attention` contract rather than jumping to unrelated post-attention logic.

- Added optional llama-family `q_norm.bin` / `k_norm.bin` paths in `LayerWeightPaths`, extended `LayerWeights` with optional Q/K norm buffers + presence flags, and loaded those weights through `RealModelInferenceEngine`.
- The llama hybrid decode path now applies per-head Q/K RMSNorm on CPU between ANE QKV projection and RoPE/attention, matching the EdgeRunner reference ordering.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter 'test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLoadsOptionalQKNormWeightsWhenPresent|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLeavesQKNormAbsentWhenFilesMissing|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaRequiresBothQKNormWeights|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLoadsOptionalQKNorms|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaKeepsMissingQKNormsOptional|test_applyPerHeadRMSNormInPlaceMatchesReference|llamaLayerPathsExposeOptionalQKNormArtifacts'`
- Fixed a second real GGUF bridge bug in the sibling `Edgerunner` package: GGUF Llama/Qwen `attn_q.weight` / `attn_k.weight` are now inverse-interleaved after transpose before being written to Espresso `wq.bin` / `wk.bin`.
- Fixed reusable GGUF artifact metadata so `metadata.json` now persists `ropeTheta` and `eosToken`.
- Bridge verification passed:
- `swift test --filter 'llamaQKWeightsInverseInterleaved|nonQKTensorNotInverseInterleaved|qkNormsExportedWhenPresent|llamaAlsoTransposes'` in `../Edgerunner`
- `swift test --filter 'qwenLayerQKNormMappings|llamaLayerQKNormMappings'` in `../Edgerunner`
- `swift test --filter GGUFModelLoader`
- Real Qwen A/B smoke on prompt `Hello`, `8` tokens, via kept prepared artifacts and `espresso-generate --json`, changed materially after the Q/K permutation + metadata fixes:
- old artifact text: `Hello粮油.pathname fasting fasting Epidemi Pal fasting fasting`
- new artifact text: `Hello粮油 athletics(peer fasting模板ۃ fasting模板`
- Fixed a real llama hybrid runtime regression: `ensureHybridCompiledLlama` now populates `compiledHybridLlamaQKNormWeights`, so the direct `.gguf -> prepare -> build -> generate` runner no longer aborts with `Llama hybrid decode state is unavailable`.
- Direct GGUF verification now reaches generation end to end:
- `ESPRESSO_GGUF_KEEP_WEIGHT_DIR=1 swift run EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit "Hello" 4`
- output: `Hello粮油 athletics(peer fasting`
- throughput: `14.72 tok/s`, compile `22651 ms`, first token `104.20 ms`
- Tokenizer decode is not the root cause for simple prompts:
- Espresso encodes `"Hello"` as token `9707`
- Hugging Face `AutoTokenizer` and the raw `tokenizers` library decode Espresso’s generated token IDs to the exact same garbage text, so the remaining bug is upstream in model execution / converted weights rather than text decoding
- Q/K norm is active but still insufficient: temporarily removing `q_norm.bin` / `k_norm.bin` from the prepared artifact changes the generated text materially, which proves the new path is affecting generation, but the output remains incoherent
- The fixes are real and affect generation, but the Qwen GGUF output is still not coherent enough to mark the smoke criterion complete. There is at least one remaining Qwen-specific runtime or conversion mismatch beyond Q/K norm, Q/K layout, and persisted rope/eos metadata.

# Publishable 1B Espresso vs Core ML Benchmark 2026-03-18

- [ ] Generalize the batch compare path to accept `ModelRegistry.llama3_2_1b` instead of hard-coding GPT-2.
- [ ] Add a reusable Llama-family Core ML reference runner that uses RMSNorm + lm head weights from the shared weights directory.
- [ ] Keep the existing GPT-2 benchmark path intact while routing 1B runs through the new Llama runner.
- [ ] Add focused tests for model selection, coreml path validation, and benchmark report aggregation.
- [ ] Run a publishable 1B smoke benchmark with explicit `llama3_2_1b` weights/tokenizer/Core ML paths and record the measured result.

# Llama 3.2 1B Correctness And Benchmark Follow-Up 2026-03-19

- [x] Isolate the long-running Llama benchmark path into startup cost vs ANE compile vs decode correctness.
- [x] Fix the Llama Metal RoPE fast path so cached KV cache bindings are no longer rotated in-place with the wrong layout.
- [x] Remove the approximate FP16 CPU fallback head from the Llama path and use the exact shared LM-head argmax path instead.
- [x] Re-run focused runtime checks for `Hello` and `Hello,` on the updated Espresso path.
- [ ] Prove that the public `anemll` Core ML artifact matches Hugging Face `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` greedy outputs before calling the benchmark a same-model publishable comparison.

# Llama Repetition Debug 2026-03-19

- [ ] Find the first token position where Espresso diverges from Hugging Face on greedy decode.
- [ ] Separate fresh-prompt prefill drift from autoregressive decode drift by testing successive fixed prefixes.
- [ ] Inspect the implicated Llama trunk/KV path and patch the minimal root cause.
- [ ] Re-run a long greedy generation smoke to confirm repetition is materially reduced.

# Metal SDPA Bisect 2026-03-19

- [x] Add an env-gated non-fused Metal decode-context fallback in the shared hybrid decode path.
- [x] Add deterministic fused decode SDPA correctness coverage on the small Metal attention fixture.
- [x] Re-run the long `Once upon a time` Llama greedy smoke with fused SDPA disabled and compare the first divergence point against Hugging Face.
- [x] Decide from that evidence whether the next fix target is fused Metal SDPA or the shared RoPE/KV path.

## Review

- Added `ESPRESSO_DISABLE_METAL_FUSED_SDPA=1` handling in the shared hybrid decode path so runtime bisects can swap fused SDPA for the older decode-context kernel without changing the rest of the Llama engine wiring.
- Added deterministic Metal attention coverage for:
- `runDecodeContextIntoSurface` on a GQA fixture
- `runFusedDecodeSDPAIntoSurface` on both MHA and GQA fixtures
- Corrected the local GQA reference mapping in the tests to use grouped-query head replication (`head / (heads / kvHeads)`), not modulo mapping.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter test_hybrid_decode_can_disable_fused_metal_sdpa_by_environment`
- `swift test --filter 'test_metal_fused_decode_sdpa_into_surface_matches_reference_for_gqa|test_metal_decode_context_into_surface_matches_reference_for_gqa|test_metal_fused_decode_sdpa_into_surface_matches_reference_on_small_problem|test_metal_decode_context_into_surface_matches_reference_on_small_problem'`
- Real Llama runtime smoke with fused SDPA disabled:
- `ESPRESSO_DISABLE_METAL_FUSED_SDPA=1 .build/debug/espresso-generate generate --weights .artifacts/llama3_2_1b --tokenizer .artifacts/llama3_2_1b_tokenizer --no-bootstrap --no-stats -n 128 "Once upon a time"`
- Output was byte-for-byte identical to the prior looping continuation, so the remaining long-horizon drift is not isolated to the fused Metal SDPA kernel.
- Token-level verification with `espresso-generate --json` plus local Hugging Face kept the first divergence at generated token index `26` (`Espresso 1283` vs `HF 2030`), confirming that disabling fused SDPA did not move the failure point.
- Current next target: the shared Llama RoPE/KV state path, because both fused and non-fused Metal decode-context kernels now have deterministic small-fixture coverage and the long-form runtime still drifts.

# Llama Cached Binding Coherency Fix 2026-03-19

- [x] Rework Metal cached bindings so they cache surface metadata instead of long-lived locked `IOSurface` bindings.
- [x] Create short-lived Metal bindings per dispatch/command buffer so mutable Q/K/V/context surfaces do not outlive ANE/CPU writes.
- [ ] Keep the HF prefix regression and cached-binding policy tests green while re-enabling the Llama cached path.
- [ ] Re-run the HF prefix regression and a long greedy smoke to prove the cached path no longer drifts into loops.

# Metal SDPA Drift Bisect 2026-03-19

- [x] Add an opt-in env toggle that bypasses fused Metal SDPA in the shared hybrid decode path.
- [x] Add focused fused-SDPA correctness coverage on small decode-context problems.
- [x] Run a long greedy Llama smoke with fused Metal SDPA disabled and compare the first divergence/output quality against Hugging Face.

## Review

- Added `ESPRESSO_DISABLE_METAL_FUSED_SDPA=1` in the shared hybrid decode path so runtime bisects can swap fused Metal SDPA for the older decode-context kernel without changing the default path.
- Added focused coverage for the toggle plus direct fused/unfused Metal decode-context reference checks, including a small GQA case. Verified with:
- `swift test --filter HybridDecodeForwardPassTests`
- `swift test --filter 'test_metal_fused_decode_sdpa_into_surface_matches_reference_for_gqa|test_metal_decode_context_into_surface_matches_reference_for_gqa|test_metal_fused_decode_sdpa_into_surface_matches_reference_on_small_problem|test_metal_decode_context_into_surface_matches_reference_on_small_problem'`
- Added `ModelRegistry.llama3_2_1b_ctx512` because the local Llama 3.2 1B artifacts in `.artifacts/llama3_2_1b*/metadata.json` advertise `maxSeq: 512` while the public registry entry remains `2048`.
- Verified the aligned local config with:
- `swift test --filter HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests`
- On the aligned `llama3_2_1b_ctx512` path, both fused and non-fused 128-token `Once upon a time` runs now produce the same coherent continuation instead of the earlier pathological loop:
- `ESPRESSO_DISABLE_METAL_FUSED_SDPA=1 .build/debug/espresso-generate generate --model llama3_2_1b_ctx512 --weights .artifacts/llama3_2_1b_ctx512 --tokenizer .artifacts/llama3_2_1b_tokenizer --no-bootstrap --no-stats -n 128 "Once upon a time"`
- `.build/debug/espresso-generate generate --model llama3_2_1b_ctx512 --weights .artifacts/llama3_2_1b_ctx512 --tokenizer .artifacts/llama3_2_1b_tokenizer --no-bootstrap --no-stats -n 128 "Once upon a time"`
- Local Hugging Face greedy generation for the same prompt is still different, so parity is not solved yet. Using the tokenizer to compare the aligned Espresso text against HF moved the first divergence to generated token `31` rather than the earlier token-`26` bad state.
- Current conclusion: fused Metal SDPA is not the primary remaining long-horizon bug on the aligned local artifact. The remaining gap is now more likely in shared higher-level state evolution or artifact/export differences than in the small fused SDPA kernel math itself.

# Llama 1B Parity Recovery Plan 2026-03-19

- [ ] Make local runtime config resolution artifact-driven for Llama debug/benchmark runs so `weights/metadata.json` cannot silently disagree with the registry when `--model` is passed.
- [ ] Add a hardware-gated long-form HF parity regression for `llama3_2_1b_ctx512` that records the first divergence token on at least one 128-token greedy prompt.
- [ ] Add a token-31 aligned-state debug path that dumps layer-0 `qOut`, `kOut` pre/post RoPE, `kCacheFull`, `vCacheFull`, `projectionContextIn`, and `ffnOut` for Espresso and a CPU/HF reference.
- [ ] Patch the first stage that actually diverges on the aligned path, then rerun short-prefix and long-form parity for both cached and non-cached Llama paths.
- [ ] Re-enable Llama cached hybrid bindings by default only after the aligned HF long-form parity gate passes.
- [ ] Replace the current LUT4 `anemll` Core ML reference with an exact same-weight Core ML artifact, verify short prompt parity, then rerun the publishable Espresso vs Core ML benchmark.

# GGUF Throughput Grounding 2026-03-19

- [x] Inspect the available GGUF and tokenizer assets under `/tmp/edgerunner-models`.
- [x] Run the Espresso GGUF generation path on the local Qwen GGUF and capture the reported `tokens/sec`.
- [x] Record the grounded GGUF throughput result and any caveats in the review notes.

## Review

- Local assets under `/tmp/edgerunner-models` include `Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf`, `Qwen3-1.7B-Q8_0.gguf`, and a matching tokenizer directory at `/tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit`.
- Fixed three GGUF bridge/runtime blockers before the Qwen model could run:
- `GGUFModelLoader` now writes runtime-compatible metadata (`architecture = llama`) and materializes `lm_head.bin` from tied embeddings when `output.weight` is absent.
- `EspressoModelConfig` now preserves explicit `attention.key_length`, so Qwen3 flows through with `headDim = 128` instead of the incorrect derived `64`.
- The hybrid Llama runtime now supports `attentionDim = nHead * headDim` separately from `dModel` by threading `qDim` through `LayerWeights`, the hybrid decode MIL generators, ANE hybrid decode kernel compilation, Metal output projection validation, and the RoPE hook.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter MILGeneratorTests`
- `swift test --filter ModelConfigTests`
- `swift test --skip-build --filter GGUFModelLoaderTests`
- Grounded throughput from a reused converted Qwen GGUF artifact via `espresso-generate`:
- prompt `Hello`, `16` generated tokens
- `tok_per_s = 19.02`
- `compile_ms = 16097.29`
- `first_token_ms = 20.61`
- Grounded end-to-end throughput from the direct GGUF runner:
- `.build/debug/EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit "Hello" 16`
- prepare/convert time: `139231 ms`
- engine build time: `2145 ms`
- generation throughput: `20.22 tok/s`
- compile time: `16776 ms`
- first token latency: `7.45 ms`
- Output quality is not yet trustworthy for Qwen3. The model now runs and can be benchmarked, but Espresso still does not import or execute Qwen’s per-head `attn_q_norm.weight` / `attn_k_norm.weight`, so this is a runtime-broadening + throughput result, not a correctness-complete Qwen implementation.
- The Metal RoPE fast path was a real Espresso bug: cached layer bindings exposed `kCacheFull`, but the fused Metal RoPE path treated that binding like a per-token `kOut` surface and indexed it with `laneStride`. The Llama path now stays on cached Metal SDPA with the safe CPU RoPE hook.
- The large-vocab Llama CPU fallback head was also changed to an exact path. Espresso no longer converts the full LM head to FP16 on engine build; the fallback now uses the engine's exact block-pruned FP32 argmax over the shared LM head.
- Added a real-model `test_llama32GreedyNextTokenPrefixesMatchHFReference` hardware regression that loads local `Llama-3.2-1B` artifacts once and checks the Hugging Face greedy next-token ladder for:
- `Hello,` -> `358` (`" I"`)
- `Hello, I` -> `1097` (`" am"`)
- `Hello, I am` -> `8173` (`" interested"`)
- `Hello, I am interested` -> `922` (`" about"`)
- Added a new hybrid cached-binding policy helper and unit coverage. Llama now opts out of cached Metal bindings by default, with `ESPRESSO_ENABLE_LLAMA_HYBRID_CACHED_BINDINGS=1` as an explicit opt-in, because the cached path keeps IOSurfaces locked for the full binding lifetime while ANE and CPU continue mutating those surfaces.
- Runtime validation of that cached-binding change is still in flight: the real-model prefix test is compile-bound in the first hybrid QKV bucket, so the correctness improvement is not yet claimed as proven.
- Focused verification passed after the fixes:
- `swift test --filter 'HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests|ClassifierStrategyTests'`
- Hugging Face is now the higher-confidence source of truth for the base checkpoint:
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` next-token logits for `Hello,` rank token `358` (`" I"`) above token `856` (`" my"`).
- Hugging Face greedy `Hello` continuation is tokens `[11, 358, 1097, 8173]`, decoded as `Hello, I am interested`.
- Updated Espresso runtime checks now align materially better with Hugging Face than the Core ML artifact:
- `Hello,` with `1` token: Espresso generated token `358`, decoded `Hello, I`
- `Hello` with `4` tokens: Espresso generated `[11, 358, 1097, 264]`, decoded `Hello, I am a`
- The current public `anemll` Core ML artifact does not match Hugging Face greedy behavior for the same prompt:
- `Hello,` with `1` token: Core ML generated token `856`, decoded `Hello, my`
- `Hello` with `4` tokens: Core ML generated `[11, 856, 836, 374]`, decoded `Hello, my name is`
- The artifact metadata explains part of that mismatch:
- `.artifacts/anemll_llama3_2_1b_ctx512/meta.yaml` advertises `lut_ffn: 4` and `lut_lmhead: 4`
- the compiled Core ML metadata also records `com.anemll.lut_bits = 4`
- so the current Core ML reference is a LUT-quantized `Anemll` package, not a behaviorally exact full-precision base-model oracle
- Latest executed Espresso vs Core ML wrapper result on prompt `Hello`, `4` tokens:
- Espresso: `23.28 tok/s`, text `Hello, I am a`, compile `12958.49 ms`
- Core ML: `67.05 tok/s`, text `, my name is`
- Because the public Core ML artifact diverges from Hugging Face on the claimed base-model prompt checks, the benchmark is now publishable only as `Espresso vs this Core ML artifact`, not yet as a verified same-model benchmark.
- The cached-binding lifetime bug is fixed in `MetalAttentionKernel`: `CachedLayerBindings` now stores only decode-surface metadata, the blocking Metal paths create fresh `SurfaceBinding`s per call, and the async submit/scatter paths retain those transient bindings until the command buffer completes.
- Focused compile/test verification after that change passed:
- `swift build --target Espresso`
- `swift build --target RealModelInference`
- `swift build --target RealModelInferenceTests`
- `swift test --skip-build --filter 'HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests|ClassifierStrategyTests'`
- The cached-path short-prefix gate passed under `ESPRESSO_ENABLE_LLAMA_HYBRID_CACHED_BINDINGS=1`:
- `ANE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1 swift test --skip-build --filter test_llama32GreedyNextTokenPrefixesMatchHFReference`
- Runtime: passed after `579.425` seconds on the first ANE compile.
- Long-form greedy drift is still present and is not specific to cached bindings:
- Cached path (`ESPRESSO_ENABLE_LLAMA_HYBRID_CACHED_BINDINGS=1`) with `Once upon a time`, `128` tokens:
- duplicated the first paragraph and restarted with `Once upon a time`
- Non-cached path produced the same `128`-token output on the same prompt.
- Local Hugging Face greedy output for the same prompt is materially different and cleaner, so the remaining long-horizon bug is elsewhere in Espresso’s decode path.
- Token-level comparison shows the first divergence from Hugging Face at generated token index `26` on `Once upon a time`:
- Espresso token `1283`
- Hugging Face token `2030`
- Because the long greedy smoke still diverges and loops, the Llama cached path remains disabled by default in `RealModelInferenceEngine.supportsHybridCachedBindings`.

# Exact-Base Core ML Baseline 2026-03-19

- [x] Verify which public Core ML artifacts actually target the base `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` model instead of the instruct variant.
- [x] Choose the narrowest practical exact-base Core ML package for first execution, preferring the lighter `anemll` `ctx512` package while the full Meta weight conversion continues.
- [x] Add a local fixed-token benchmark adapter for the `anemll` Core ML runtime so we can measure prefill and decode throughput without scraping the interactive chat script.
- [x] Download and extract the selected `anemll` exact-base Core ML package into local artifacts and prove the adapter runs end to end.
- [ ] Use the adapter plus Espresso’s local `llama3_2_1b` weights to capture a publishable same-model benchmark and record the method/caveats.
- [ ] Add a same-process Espresso benchmark path for 1B runs so warm measurements do not repay full weight load + engine build on every wrapper invocation.

## Review

- Public exact-base Core ML candidates exist under `anemll/anemll-Meta-Llama-3.2-1B-*`; the previously inspected `yacht` package is the instruct model and is not the right source of truth for the user’s requested base benchmark.
- `anemll` `ctx512_0.1.1` is the most practical first baseline because it keeps the exact base model while reducing the Core ML artifact footprint to one FFN chunk plus embeddings and lm head.
- The in-repo native Core ML runner is currently too narrow for these public packages because it expects a single rank-2 token input and a single rank-3 hidden-state output, while the `anemll` runtime is split across embeddings, FFN/prefill, and lm-head Core ML models.
- Added `scripts/run_anemll_coreml_benchmark.py` plus focused Python tests so exact-base Core ML throughput can be measured directly and emitted as JSON.
- Downloaded and extracted `.artifacts/anemll_llama3_2_1b_ctx512/` and executed a real smoke run:
- prompt: `Hello`
- max tokens: `4`
- generated text: `", my name is"`
- decode throughput: about `36.55 tok/s`
- Added `scripts/run_publishable_llama32_compare.py` to orchestrate Espresso vs exact-base Core ML runs with an optional context-matched hardlinked Espresso weights variant.
- On the Espresso side, the converted Meta artifact now passes a real short generation smoke after fixing the tokenizer-directory validation, clamping exported `maxSeq`, and rewriting llama GQA `wk.bin`/`wv.bin` to the raw grouped K/V shape expected by `RealModelInferenceEngine`.
- Remaining blocker: the first publishable wrapper run on the prepared `ctx512` Espresso artifact is still spending its time in the initial ANE compile path for hybrid decode kernels, so the final same-model comparison JSON has not landed yet.
- Follow-up diagnosis from direct live sampling on March 19, 2026:
- the main publishable-benchmark blocker is no longer best described as a `ctx512` compile bug
- the fresh 1B Espresso process spends its first 50-60 seconds in `BlobWeightLoader.load(...)` while rebuilding the engine
- only after that does it enter hybrid ANE kernel compilation
- because `run_publishable_llama32_compare.py` shells out to a fresh Espresso process, it repays that engine startup cost on every run
- the next fix is to benchmark Espresso in one process with warm iterations, not to keep treating this as a wrapper-only or `ctx512`-only ANE regression
- Donor-cache reuse in `ANEInterop` is now fixed and covered by focused tests; the first cold 1-token `ctx512` run dropped from timing out past 300 seconds to about 26.7 seconds in the earlier traced benchmark path.
- The benchmark harness now reaches a real same-model compare, but it exposed a separate Llama correctness bug:
- Core ML on prompt `Hello,` predicts token `856` (`" my"`)
- Espresso predicted token `1174` (`","`) even on a fresh one-step continuation
- Root-cause analysis points at the Llama Metal RoPE fast path:
- cached layer bindings expose `qOut + kCache/vCache`, not `qOut + kOut/vOut`
- `submitFullPipelinedDecodeFromCachedBindings` applies in-place RoPE to the cached K binding using `laneStride`
- the KV cache is laid out with `cacheStride`, so prompt-prefill K cache entries are corrupted once prompt length exceeds one token
- Current fix: disable the unsafe Llama Metal RoPE path while keeping cached Metal SDPA bindings enabled; regression coverage added in `HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests`
- Remaining verification step: wait for the first cold compile on the safe path to finish, then rerun the `Hello,` correctness check and the publishable `run_publishable_llama32_compare.py` benchmark capture.
- Follow-up results after the safe-path compile completed:
- Espresso fresh `Hello,` continuation now emits token `358` (`" I"`) instead of the earlier broken comma loop
- Espresso fresh `Hello` continuation now begins `Hello, I am ...`, matching Hugging Face on the first three greedy tokens
- Hugging Face greedy reference on March 19, 2026:
- `Hello` -> `Hello, I am interested`
- `Hello,` -> `Hello, I am interested about`
- Espresso still diverges later in the continuation:
- `Hello` currently yields `Hello, I am a`
- so the remaining Espresso mismatch is now narrowed to later-token decode drift, not first-token prompt handling
- Corrected CPU/Metal RoPE math from adjacent-pair rotation to Llama half-split `rotate_half` semantics and added focused CPUOps regression coverage
- Fixed an additional Core ML reference bug in `GPT2DemoSupport.swift`: the native single-mlpackage Core ML runner was applying LayerNorm math to llama hidden states; it now uses RMSNorm for llama and has focused `EspressoGenerateTests`
- Fixed an off-by-one issue in `scripts/run_anemll_coreml_benchmark.py` so prefill leaves the last prompt token for decode, with focused Python test coverage
- Even after the wrapper fix, the public `anemll` split-package baseline still does not match Hugging Face:
- `Hello` still decodes as `, my name is`
- `Hello,` still decodes as ` my name is Emily`
- so the current `anemll` package path is not a publishable source of truth for exact-model parity
- Tried switching to a self-exported single-trunk Core ML baseline via `scripts/export_llama_coreml.py --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B --seq-len 16`, but `coremltools` currently fails during conversion on a Torch `int` op (`TypeError: only 0-dimensional arrays can be converted to Python scalars`)
- Current publishable-benchmark blocker:
- Espresso is substantially closer to Hugging Face now
- the public split Core ML package is still not HF-parity
- the self-export path needs an additional `coremltools` export fix before we have a trustworthy same-model Core ML baseline

# 1B Publishable Benchmark 2026-03-18

- [ ] Generalize the benchmark compare path so `llama3_2_1b` can run end-to-end against a Core ML package without GPT-2 bootstrap assumptions.
- [ ] Accept the llama weight layout produced by `scripts/convert_weights_llama.py` so `final_norm.bin` works as a top-level norm file.
- [ ] Add focused tests for llama weight-path compatibility and Core ML model selection.
- [ ] Run the narrowest practical verification path and record the benchmark setup.

# 1B Publishable Benchmark Path 2026-03-18

- [x] Inspect the current compare/suite flow and identify the Core ML path decision point.
- [x] Add a generic Core ML path resolver that preserves GPT-2 auto-bootstrap behavior and requires explicit Core ML packages for llama models.

## Review

- The CLI now treats `--coreml-model` as required for non-GPT2 benchmark runs while leaving GPT-2 auto-bootstrap intact.

# Qwen GGUF Q/K Norm Support 2026-03-19

- [x] Add optional Q/K norm artifact paths to the llama layer path model.
- [x] Extend layer weights/loading to carry optional per-head Q/K norm tensors.

- [x] Add focused tests for llama/Qwen layer paths, weight loading, and synthetic Q/K norm math.
- [ ] Re-run the direct Qwen GGUF smoke path and record whether output materially improves.

## Review

- Added optional `q_norm.bin` / `k_norm.bin` layer paths for llama-family artifacts in `LayerWeightPaths`.
- Extended `LayerWeights` to carry Q/K norm buffers plus presence flags so llama/Qwen layers can load per-head norm tensors without changing GPT-2 paths.
- `RealModelInferenceEngine` now:
- caches optional per-layer Q/K norm weights for the hybrid llama path
- copies those tensors into loaded hybrid layer weights
- applies per-head single-token RMSNorm to `qOut` and `kOut` immediately after QKV projection and before RoPE/attention
- Added focused verification in:
- `Tests/ModelSupportTests/TransformerGraphTests.swift`
- `Tests/RealModelInferenceTests/HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests.swift`
- `Tests/RealModelInferenceTests/RealModelInferenceTests.swift`
- Added `CPUOps.RMSNorm.applyPerHeadSingleTokenInPlace(...)` as the reusable per-head RMSNorm primitive used by the runtime path.
- Verified locally with:
- `swift test --filter 'TransformerGraphTests|HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests'`
- `swift test --filter 'test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLoadsOptionalQKNormWeightsWhenPresent|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaLeavesQKNormAbsentWhenFilesMissing|test_loadHybridLayerWeightsLlamaRequiresBothQKNormWeights'`
- `swift test --filter GGUFModelLoaderTests`
- In the sibling `Edgerunner` repo, added `attn_q_norm.weight -> q_norm.bin` and `attn_k_norm.weight -> k_norm.bin` mapping plus focused tests:
- `swift test --filter EspressoTensorNameMapperTests` in `/Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner`
- Grounded Qwen GGUF runtime result after the bridge/runtime fixes:
- `swift run EspressoGGUFRunner /tmp/edgerunner-models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf /tmp/edgerunner-models/mlx-community-Qwen3-0.6B-8bit "Hello" 16`
- The prepared artifact now reports `310 tensors` instead of the earlier `254`, confirming the new Q/K norm artifacts are emitted.
- Despite that, the 16-token smoke output is still not coherent:
- `Hello粮油(Date Player模板карт Christoph proveblah fasting Caloriesڂύпре cheap.] Une`
- Current blocker: Q/K norm import + execution is fixed, but Qwen GGUF coherence is still broken. The next likely issue is another Qwen-specific behavior gap beyond Q/K norm, not the artifact path or the immediate post-QKV RMSNorm step.
- Non-GPT2 `compare` calls now stay on the bench path instead of trying to enter the live TUI.
- The new tests exercise the explicit-model, missing-model, and GPT-2 override cases for Core ML path selection.
- Added `tokenizer.json` support for llama-family BPE tokenizers so `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` no longer depends on SentencePiece-only assets.
- Materialized `.artifacts/llama3_2_1b_tokenizer/` from the cached Meta tokenizer files and added a real local token-ID regression test against known Hugging Face outputs.
- Full `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` runtime verification still needs the converted local weight artifacts to finish and an actual matching 1B Core ML package in the workspace.

# Single-Process Prompt Suite Harness 2026-03-18

- [x] Inspect the existing `espresso-generate` compare path and the shell-based suite runner to find the minimal reusable integration point.
- [x] Implement a single-process prompt-suite harness that reuses one Core ML load/compile across prompts instead of recompiling per prompt.
- [x] Keep the existing compare logic and report schema reusable so suite output remains comparable with current artifacts.
- [x] Add focused tests and run verification for the new harness.

## Review

- Added `espresso-generate suite` with `--prompts`, `--runs`, `--results-tsv`, and `--no-cold`.
- The suite path now:
- loads the prompt file once
- computes one shared Core ML sequence length for the suite
- creates one reusable `RealModelInferenceEngine`
- creates one reusable Core ML reference runner
- emits the existing per-prompt `compare.json` artifacts plus `metadata.json` and `suite-summary.json`
- The launcher `./espresso` now forwards `suite`, and `scripts/run_autoresearch_suite.sh` is a thin wrapper over the new in-process command while preserving the existing autoresearch env defaults.
- Focused verification passed:
- `swift test --filter EspressoGenerateTests`
- The new focused tests cover:
- suite CLI flag parsing
- prompt-suite file parsing
- duplicate prompt-id rejection
- suite Core ML sequence-length planning
- suite summary aggregation/verdict logic
- Runtime smoke note:
- attempted real suite runs against GPT-2 weights and explicit Core ML packages stalled inside Core ML’s initial on-device model load/specialization on this machine before the first prompt artifact was written
- `sample` showed the process spending its time in `ReusableGPT2CoreMLBenchmarkRunner.init` -> `MLModel(contentsOf:)`, which is consistent with the design: Core ML is loaded once up front for the suite instead of once per prompt

# Prompt Suite Compare Verification 2026-03-18

- [x] Create a temporary 10-prompt GPT-2 continuation suite for executed compare runs.
- [x] Run the suite with explicit GPT-2 weights/tokenizer and the cached `gpt2_seq256` Core ML model.
- [x] Aggregate token/text match gates plus per-prompt Espresso/Core ML throughput.
- [x] Summarize whether longer continuations remain coherent enough and how Espresso performance compares to Core ML across the suite.

## Review

- Ran: `./scripts/run_autoresearch_suite.sh --runs 1 --warmup 0 --iterations 1 --max-tokens 64 --no-cold --prompts /tmp/espresso-prompt-suite-20260318.txt --model gpt2 --weights .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_124m --tokenizer .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_tokenizer --coreml-model ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Espresso/demo/gpt2_coreml/gpt2_seq256.mlpackage --coreml-seq-len 256`
- The suite executed all 10 prompt compare runs and wrote `results/autoresearch/suite-20260318-214351/suite-summary.json`.
- The runner exited non-zero only at the final pretty-print step because of an existing jq formatting bug; the measured compare artifacts and summary JSON were still produced.
- Aggregate result from `suite-summary.json`:
- `n_prompts: 10`
- `espresso_tok_s_median: 45.8657`
- `coreml_tok_s_median: 56.3664`
- `speedup_median: 0.8092x`
- `all_token_match: false`
- `all_text_match: false`
- `all_correctness_gates_pass: false`
- Prompt-level parity passed on 7/10 prompts and failed on 3/10 prompts:
- failed: `civic_update`, `lab_surprise`, `lesson_reflection`
- Representative quality signal:
- outputs are generally locally coherent, but repetitive and weak in longer continuations
- mismatch cases range from small lexical drift to meaningfully different continuations

# Generation Coherence Verification 2026-03-18

- [x] Inspect real-model generation tests and compare-path parity checks that can serve as source of truth.
- [x] Run focused `swift test` coverage for `RealModelInferenceTests` and `EspressoGenerateTests`.
- [x] If the focused tests pass, run one smallest practical compare/generate invocation and capture whether runtime parity or compilation fails.
- [x] Document what the executed tests prove about output coherence, and what remains unproven without a successful hardware generation run.

## Review

- `swift test --filter EspressoGenerateTests` passed.
- `swift test --filter RealModelInferenceTests` passed, but its `test_fullModelGeneration` case is hardware/env gated and can pass by early return when prerequisites are absent.
- Direct runtime check passed:
- `.build/debug/espresso-generate generate --model gpt2 --weights .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_124m --tokenizer .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_tokenizer --no-bootstrap --no-stats -n 8 "Hello"`
- Output: `Hello, I'm sorry, but I'm`
- Direct compare check passed:
- `.build/debug/espresso-generate compare --bench --json --no-bootstrap --no-power --compare-warmup 0 --compare-iterations 1 --model gpt2 --weights .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_124m --tokenizer .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_tokenizer --coreml-model .worktrees/wave4-e2e-inference/.artifacts/gpt2_coreml/gpt2_seq16.mlpackage --coreml-seq-len 16 -n 8 "Hello"`
- Espresso and Core ML produced identical tokens and identical text:
- `token_match: true`
- `text_match: true`
- Shared decoded text: `Hello, I'm sorry, but I'm`
- On this one short run, coherence is established only for a short greedy continuation on GPT-2 124M, not as a general quality claim for longer outputs or other models.

# Autoresearch Harness Readiness Fixes

- [ ] Unignore and track the hardened suite assets used by the referee workflow.
- [ ] Align the scaffolded results contract and referee prompt with the suite-based workflow.
- [ ] Fix the judge summary percentage display bug.
- [ ] Re-run script checks and scaffold verification, then record the review result.

# GPT-2 Throughput Phase 5

- [x] Keep `edb74ce` as the current safe rollback checkpoint.
- [x] Falsify low-cost runtime knobs and dead-end speculative shortcuts before deeper refactor.
- [x] Add a stateful, checkpointable GPT-2 hybrid runtime:
- [x] `DecodeState` checkpoint/restore
- [x] append-only KV-cache rollback for speculative windows
- [x] final hidden / head-ready surface checkpoint
- [x] Add a real two-token verifier flow over the hybrid runtime with promotion/rollback semantics.
- [x] Add a truncated-layer GPT-2 draft runtime using the same weights.
- [x] Wire a guarded speculative GPT-2 path into `RealModelInferenceEngine.generate` for `temperature = 0`.
- [x] Preserve deterministic parity and current fallback behavior.
- [x] Benchmark guarded speculative decode; keep it off by default unless it reproduces a win.

## Review

- Default path remains the safe baseline and still passes `swift build`, `swift test --filter RealModelInferenceTests`, and `swift test --filter EspressoGenerateTests`.
- Guarded speculative decode is now available behind `ESPRESSO_ENABLE_GPT2_SPECULATIVE=1`.
- The stateful speculative runtime includes:
- draft/tail layer-range runtimes
- `DecodeState` checkpoint + rollback
- per-layer K/V cache rollback for speculative tokens
- final hidden-surface checkpoint and restore
- Shallow drafts performed best in the compare sweep. Best reproduced compare result was with the 1-layer draft:
- Espresso `67.67 tok/s`
- Core ML `56.99 tok/s`
- about `1.19x` faster with `tokens:true` and `text:true`
- Mid-depth drafts were weaker:
- `draft_layers=4`: Espresso `65.02 tok/s`
- `draft_layers=6`: Espresso `66.03 tok/s`
- Benchmarking is noisy on this machine. A rerun of `bench` with the 1-layer draft reproduced a win at:
- Espresso `67.96 tok/s`
- Core ML `59.12 tok/s`
- about `1.15x`
- Because the speculative path is still compile-retry heavy and not yet stable enough to claim as the new default, it remains opt-in and defaults to a 1-layer draft only when explicitly enabled.

# GPT-2 Throughput Phase 6

- [x] Reuse compiled speculative runtimes across `generate` calls inside `RealModelInferenceEngine`.
- [x] Patch `ane_interop.m` so `preferCached` attempts a real cached load path before compile fallback.
- [x] Persist compiled donor `net.plist` state so later processes can actually hit the cached-load branch.
- [x] Rebuild and rerun focused tests.
- [x] Re-benchmark compile latency and throughput for speculative and default paths.

## Review

- `RealModelInferenceEngine` now caches speculative draft/verifier runtime pairs keyed by `(draftLayerCount, maxSeq)` and resets them per `generate` call instead of recompiling them each time.
- `ane_interop.m` now:
- tries cached load first when `ANE_COMPILE_CACHE_POLICY=preferCached` and `compiledModelExists == 1`
- falls back to compile only if cached load fails
- persists `td/net.plist` into the user cache directory after successful load so future processes have a donor artifact
- Focused verification still passes:
- `swift build`
- `swift test --filter RealModelInferenceTests`
- `swift test --filter EspressoGenerateTests`
- Trace verification:
- first tiny traced speculative run seeded donor cache entries
- second traced run showed `compiledExists=1` broadly and no longer printed `cached donor net.plist missing`
- Measured speculative compare after donor seeding:
- Espresso `67.71 tok/s`
- Core ML `58.51 tok/s`
- about `1.16x`
- `compile_ms` improved from about `23.42s` before donor persistence to about `18.49s` after donor persistence on the same cold CLI compare shape
- Measured default compare after cache-path patch:
- Espresso `66.90 tok/s`
- Core ML `58.49 tok/s`
- about `1.14x`

# Qwen GGUF Correctness

- [x] Make the exact tanh-form SiLU the default ANE graph expansion, with a legacy sigmoid escape hatch only for debugging.
- [x] Route Qwen llama-family hybrid decode through the CPU attention helper by default, while preserving explicit env overrides.
- [x] Rebuild focused tests, rerun fresh-artifact next-token checks, and rescore the raw GGUF continuation.

## Review

- Root cause was a compound runtime numerical issue on the Qwen GGUF path:
- the default ANE SiLU graph expansion (`x * sigmoid(x)`) introduced measurable FFN drift on Qwen
- the current Metal decode-attention path still diverged on Qwen, while the CPU decode-attention helper matched the exact-stage reference
- The production fix is now:
- exact tanh-form SiLU by default in `ANEBuilder+Composites.swift`
- default CPU decode-attention preference for Qwen llama-family configs in `RealModelInferenceEngine`, with `ESPRESSO_FORCE_METAL_DECODE_ATTENTION=1` to override and `ESPRESSO_USE_CPU_DECODE_ATTENTION=1` still honored explicitly
- Focused verification after the change:
- `swift test --filter 'test_prefersCPUDecodeAttention|test_usesHybridLayerInputRebinding|siluUsesTanhIdentityByDefault|siluCanForceLegacySigmoidPath|siluSupportsFP32Experiment|test_hybrid_decode_can_enable_cpu_attention_by_environment|test_hybrid_decode_can_enable_cpu_attention_v_dim_major_by_environment|test_cpu_decode_context_matches_grouped_contiguous_reference|test_cpu_decode_context_respects_modulo_kv_head_mapping'` passed
- Fresh kept-artifact cold-start still compiled successfully:
- `/var/folders/ns/xmz0zmpj7p148vdgr4bwzp8h0000gn/T/espresso_gguf_A7D44916-82B0-4A88-8D26-145555E12B75`
- Fresh-artifact next-token checks now pass on the default code path:
- prompt `[9707]` -> token `21806`
- prompt `[9707, 21806]` -> token `11`
- Raw GGUF continuation now materially improves on the default path:
- Espresso `[21806, 11, 358, 2776, 14589, 369, 279, 21340]`
- llama.cpp `[21806, 11, 358, 2776, 14589, 369, 279, 3681]`
- First divergence moved from generated token index `1` to generated token index `7`
- The remaining token-7 miss is now the tiny artifact-vs-raw GGUF gap already seen in the pure CPU artifact forward (`21340` vs `3681`), not the original first-token runtime correctness bug.

# Prompt Readiness Audit 2026-03-20

- [x] Review project workflow constraints and existing lessons before auditing the prompt requirements.
- [x] Inspect the concrete runnable surfaces in `/Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Espresso` and `/Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Edgerunner`.
- [x] Verify the protected model directory exists at `/tmp/edgerunner-models`.
- [x] Produce a concise operational-readiness checklist focused on exact paths, commands, final output contract, and forbidden actions.

## Review

- Verified the prompt can be grounded in real local paths and commands rather than placeholders.
- Confirmed protected models currently exist in `/tmp/edgerunner-models` for `0.6B`, `1.7B`, and `4B`.
- Confirmed the main executable surfaces the prompt should pin down include Espresso `swift build`, `swift test`, `./espresso`, `./.build/debug/EspressoGGUFRunner verify-qwen`, and Edgerunner `swift build` plus `swift test --filter "QwenBenchmark/decodeBenchmark"`.
- Confirmed the prompt should explicitly forbid destructive git cleanup and deletion of protected models, while allowing cleanup only for disposable `/var/folders/.../T/espresso_gguf_*` temp directories.

# Stories Benchmark 2026-03-25

- [x] Run the repo's published stories-family benchmark command (`swift run espresso-bench --ane-only --inference --layers 6 --warmup 20 --iterations 100`)
- [x] Capture the saved summary artifact at [summary.json](/Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Espresso/benchmarks/results/2026-03-25-223111/summary.json)
- [x] Identify the dominant bottlenecks from the measured breakdown

## Review

- No literal `stories.llm` file exists in the repo; the benchmark family is wired through `stories` -> `stories110m`.
- `ANE Direct`: `11.650 ms` mean, `85.83 tok/s`, compile time `7094.21 ms`
- `ANE Inference`: `10.230 ms` mean, `97.75 tok/s`, compile time `1546.64 ms`
- Direct runtime bottlenecks: `ANE compute 87.59%`, `IO 10.47%`, `CPU 1.94%`
- Inference runtime bottlenecks: `ANE compute 96.64%`, `IO 3.36%`, `CPU 0.00%`
- The current checkout is slower than the checked-in dashboard numbers in [latest.json](/Users/chriskarani/CodingProjects/Espresso/benchmarks/results/latest.json); the dominant runtime bottleneck is still ANE compute, and first-run compile cost is also material at this size.

# Stories Throughput Experiment Loop 2026-03-25

- [x] Add benchmark-visible ANE compile retry and failure counters to the generation path.
- [x] Add exact-head backend reporting and the `cpu_fp16_tiled` Stories classifier path.
- [x] Route LLaMA greedy exact decode through ANE final RMSNorm before CPU classification.
- [x] Add non-destructive experiment scripts for Stories inner-loop benchmarking and disposable worktree keep-or-revert evaluation.
- [x] Re-measure cached bindings and revert the default-on choice when it failed the keep gate on the sampled Stories prompt.
- [x] Rebuild and rerun the focused RealModelInference and EspressoGenerate verification slice.

## Review

- Added `ANECompileStats` and surfaced `compile_retry_count`, `compile_failure_count`, `exact_head_backend`, and `cached_bindings_enabled` through benchmark JSON, CSV, and prompt-suite TSV output.
- Stories exact decode now supports `cpu_fp16_tiled` directly from `lm_head.bin` when no exact float32 sidecar exists, while keeping `cpu_partitioned_fp32` as the exact fallback.
- LLaMA greedy exact paths now use the compiled final RMSNorm head before CPU argmax, removing the old CPU-side final norm from that lane.
- Added `scripts/run_stories_generate_benchmark.sh` for the fast Stories warm loop and `scripts/run_autoresearch_experiment.sh` for disposable-worktree keep-or-revert execution.
- Measured on March 25-26, 2026:
- Kept:
- `d1f2b3b` added the cached-binding Metal RoPE fast path and turned the cached-binding lane from a loss (`52.38 tok/s`) into a competitive path (`74.20 tok/s`) on the `Hello` Stories prompt while preserving exact output.
- `e061f8a` enabled cached bindings by default for `stories110m`.
- `a19c969` added labeled ANE compile telemetry and showed that the entire retry budget came from `hybrid.decodeQKVOnly.delta`, `hybrid.decodeProjectionFFN.delta`, and `hybrid.decodeFFN.delta`.
- `9b8333d` disabled Stories hybrid donor delta by default. On `Hello`, the Stories default moved from `67.89` to `71.80 tok/s`, compile time dropped from `29.88s` to `2.51s`, and compile retries/failures fell from `60/75` to `0/0`. On `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog near the river`, throughput improved from `59.73`/`70.14` baseline samples to `69.38` with exact token/text match and `0/0` compile retries/failures.
- `4b912ff` added `ESPRESSO_HYBRID_ATTENTION_WINDOW` as an opt-in approximate suffix-attention mode. It stays exact when the live context never exceeds the window and improved a long-context Stories run from `59.03` to `67.62 tok/s` with `ESPRESSO_HYBRID_ATTENTION_WINDOW=32`.
- Reverted:
- `73db8d2` reverted persistent cached Metal bindings after they failed the keep gate.
- `a1d3c2c` reverted fused post-attention compile-failure caching after it did not improve compile retries or throughput.
- `fbdd3aa` reverted skipping CPU KV scatter in the Metal RoPE path after it won on `Hello` but regressed the medium prompt (`59.73 tok/s` vs `66.31 tok/s` with the old path forced on).
- Re-measured rejected runtime knobs under the new donor-delta baseline:
- `ESPRESSO_DISABLE_HYBRID_FUSED_POST_ATTENTION=1` regressed Stories `Hello` throughput to `57.83 tok/s`, so fused post-attention stays on.
- `ESPRESSO_ENABLE_LLAMA_HYBRID_LAYER_INPUT_REBIND=1` improved `Hello` to `76.92 tok/s` but lost on the medium prompt (`68.32` vs `70.14 tok/s` baseline), so it remains opt-in rather than the Stories default.
- Verification passed:
- `swift build`
- `swift test --filter 'ClassifierStrategyTests|HybridLlamaDecodeStepTests|RealModelInferenceTests/test_loadRawFP16WeightTableIfNoExactFloat32SidecarReadsBlobPayload|RealModelInferenceTests/test_loadRawFP16WeightTableIfNoExactFloat32SidecarDefersToExactSidecar|EspressoGenerateTests/test_makePromptSuiteSummaryAggregatesPerPromptVerdicts|EspressoGenerateTests/test_aggregateBenchmarkRunsUsesWarmupAndAggregatesMeasuredLatencySamples|EspressoGenerateTests/test_optionsParseGenerateBenchmarkFlags'`
